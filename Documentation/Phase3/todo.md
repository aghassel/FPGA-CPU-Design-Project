# TODO list for phase3

- update alu opcode to match actual IR upper bits
    - potentially not necessary since TB have correct assertions for alu
    - wire IR to ALU
    - either way this has to be done for fms opcode decoding
- work on fms
    - create different switch for each case
    - copy testbench signal patten into 
- write instructions into mem
